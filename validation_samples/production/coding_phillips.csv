PC_0000,"To me perhaps the highest probability is that the rate of change will remain positive but will not be strong enough by itself to hold off the cost increases resulting from stronger world growth, the wealth effect, and ever tighter labor markets.",Tighter labor markets will contribute to cost increases that productivity gains may not offset,"The forecast that tighter labor markets will contribute to cost increases suggests inflationary pressures are building, supporting the need for restrictive monetary policy to prevent overheating",Employment
PC_0001,"Given the expectation that output will grow only modestly over the next two years and that the unemployment rate is likely to remain at roughly the present level, based upon past relationships it wouldn't be surprising in my view to see labor market slack of this size reduce the CPI inflation to a lower number than that included in the Greenbook",Labor market slack is expected to persist and will likely reduce inflation more than forecasted,Expected persistence of labor market slack and its disinflationary effects suggest monetary policy can remain accommodative without risking excessive inflation,Employment
PC_0002,"However, nominal wage increases are moderate, as are unit labor costs, and U.S. and global economic weakness could moderate gains in commodity prices and create domestic economic slack.",Moderate wage growth and potential economic slack will help contain inflation,This argument supports accommodative policy by highlighting disinflationary forces from moderate wage growth and expected economic slack that will help contain inflation pressures.,Inflation
PC_0003,"Where that is really important is in what it implies for unit labor costs, and I don't think that is quite as clear.","Unit labor costs from wage pressures may have inflationary implications, though the relationship is uncertain","The speaker identifies wage pressures as potentially leading to higher unit labor costs and inflation, suggesting a need for restrictive policy to address these emerging pressures",Inflation
PC_0004,"In light of the prolonged inflation shortfall, we need to be concerned with the possibility that inflation expectations could slip, but, at the same time, we must also be cognizant of the risks associated with allowing the labor market to tighten further and further, as the ultimate adverse effects of such tightening on inflation and financial stability may be slow to emerge.",Need to balance concerns about inflation shortfall with risks of excessive labor market tightening,"Emphasizes risks from prolonged inflation shortfall and potential for inflation expectations to decline, suggesting priority should be given to addressing inflation weakness over concerns about labor market overheating",Inflation
PC_0005,"Similarly, there seems to be deterioration in the relationship between utilization rates and consumer prices that occurred about the same time. I don't take much comfort from that; it raises uncertainty in my mind, if nothing else, about the price outlook, and it forces me to rely a little more on my intuition.",Structural breakdown in utilization-price relationships creates uncertainty about inflation outlook,"Loss of reliable inflation forecasting relationships increases uncertainty and risk, supporting more restrictive policy as a precautionary measure",Inflation
PC_0006,"From a risk-management perspective, as we begin to raise rates we should weigh the risk of significantly impeding the labor market recovery against the risk of having to scramble to adjust to unexpectedly adverse inflation developments.",Risk management approach should balance labor market and inflation risks,Emphasizes the risks of tightening too aggressively and damaging the labor market recovery,Inflation
PC_0007,We believe that our efforts to reduce inflation over time may already have filtered into price- and wage-setting behaviors so that these cyclical pressures are seen as temporary as opposed to a sustained trend toward higher inflation.,Fed's credibility has made current inflationary pressures temporary rather than persistent,"If credibility anchors expectations and makes pressures temporary, less aggressive policy tightening may be needed to control inflation",Inflation
PC_0008,"Doesn't a lot depend on where the additional growth comes from? For example, we're going to see the growth coming in manufacturing. Does that 6 percent mean what you would think it would mean, on average?",The sectoral and geographic source of economic growth affects the policy significance of aggregate unemployment rates,"This argument suggests that manufacturing growth may occur in areas with higher unemployment, meaning that aggregate unemployment rates may not accurately reflect inflationary pressures, potentially supporting more accommodative policy than headline numbers would suggest.",Employment
PC_0009,"Despite monetary and fiscal actions taken or likely to be taken soon, our forecast indicates that, without more-significant actions, unemployment rates will remain too high and inflation will remain too low for an uncomfortably long period of time.",Current policies are insufficient and more significant actions are needed,"Speaker explicitly calls for more significant policy actions beyond current measures to address persistent economic weakness, supporting more accommodative monetary policy.",Growth
PC_0010,"The overall tone at the IMF–World Bank meetings a couple of weeks ago was indeed quite striking, and it is a synchronized global slowdown, albeit one that doesn't yet amount to a global recession.",There is a synchronized global slowdown that bears close watching,Synchronized global slowdown represents a significant headwind to US economic growth that justifies accommodative policy to insulate the domestic economy,Growth
PC_0011,"There are no general signs of price pressures, although I hear more reports about tightness in skilled labor markets and the demand for professional- type jobs.",Observation of tightness in skilled labor markets and increased demand for professional jobs,"The speaker's observation of labor market tightness in skilled segments indicates strengthening employment conditions that could lead to wage pressures and inflation, supporting a more restrictive monetary policy stance to prevent the economy from overheating.",Employment
PC_0012,"Like others, I think the policy action at this meeting is a very close call, but in the end I support a pause, even in light of the continuing unfavorable inflation situation.",Policy pause despite unfavorable inflation situation,"Supporting a policy pause despite acknowledging unfavorable inflation conditions suggests accommodative stance, likely due to other economic considerations.",Inflation
PC_0013,"The point is that we are at the tail end of a series of years in which, by all our historic measures, growth has been above trend. Price pressures should be mounting at this stage, but instead they are going in the other direction.","Despite strong growth, inflation pressures are absent contrary to historical patterns",The absence of expected inflation pressures despite strong growth suggests monetary policy can remain accommodative without triggering inflation,Inflation
PC_0014,"Of course, in any case, the relationship between wage increases and overall inflation is not the easiest thing in the world to pin down in recent years.",Uncertainty about the relationship between wage increases and inflation suggests caution in policy transmission assumptions,"Uncertainty about wage-inflation transmission mechanisms suggests policymakers should be cautious about tightening policy based on wage growth expectations, supporting more accommodative policy",Inflation
PC_0015,"And importantly, while a number of costs have gone up, unit labor costs themselves continue to be, if anything, quite moderate. All of this suggests to me—though I will point out some caveats—that the incoming data are not flashing a signal that we are clearly behind the curve.",Current inflation data and moderate unit labor costs suggest Fed is not behind the curve,Assessment that current policy stance is appropriate and not overly accommodative given moderate unit labor cost pressures,Inflation
PC_0016,I'm not a big fan of the NAIRU as a way of finding out what the inflation rate is going to be,Skepticism about NAIRU as a reliable tool for inflation forecasting,"By expressing skepticism about NAIRU's reliability for inflation forecasting, the speaker suggests caution about relying on models that might justify easier policy based on lower unemployment thresholds, implying a more cautious approach to accommodation",Inflation
PC_0017,Isn't there a law that when everybody expects an upturn--if it looks unanimous--it isn't going to happen?,"Skepticism about unanimous expectations for economic upturn, suggesting continued weakness may persist","Skepticism about recovery timing suggests economic weakness may persist longer than expected, warranting continued accommodative monetary policy",Growth
PC_0018,"Putting in the word ""generally"" could actually be productive in the sense that it might show a greater concern about inflation expectations, which might keep inflation expectations better anchored.",Communication showing concern about inflation expectations could help keep them anchored,"Supports communication strategy that shows concern about inflation expectations as a tool to keep them anchored, reflecting a more hawkish communication approach consistent with restrictive policy inclinations.",Inflation
PC_0019,"However, history shows that when the unemployment rate gets as low as 4.3 percent, monetary policy tightens in an attempt to raise the unemployment rate back to full employment. But, almost always, our attempt to achieve a smooth landing ends poorly, as the unemployment rate responds much more than intended, resulting in a recession.",Historical pattern shows very low unemployment leads to policy tightening and recession,Historical pattern argues for preventing unemployment from falling too low through preemptive policy tightening,Employment
PC_0020,"Why not? Well, economic growth has been weak recently. The inflation rate hasn't risen. If anything, it has declined. It's likely to remain below target as long as wages and the price of energy remain contained. Economic growth hasn't picked up, and all of those factors indicate there's no hurry.",Recent economic growth has been weak,Weak recent growth performance is cited as a key reason supporting no hurry to tighten monetary policy,Growth
PC_0021,Shortages of work crews in some areas and shortages of equipment [are] both putting upward price and cost pressures on those aspects of the picture.,Labor shortages in oil and gas sector are contributing to upward price and cost pressures,"The speaker identifies tight labor markets (work crew shortages) as a source of inflationary pressure in the oil and gas sector. This suggests the economy may be operating at or near capacity constraints, which would typically support tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating and control inflation.",Employment
PC_0022,"Although I agree with President Plosser that the Phillips curve has certainly appeared to flatten in recent years, most estimates that I have seen of Phillips curves suggest that the relationship between changes in unemployment and changes in inflation, even though it may have become smaller, is still significant.",Phillips curve relationship between unemployment and inflation remains significant despite flattening,"A significant Phillips curve relationship means tight labor markets will eventually translate to higher inflation, supporting the case for restrictive policy to prevent overheating.",Inflation
PC_0023,"The way this is working, the only cost is between inflation and unemployment.",Monetary policy involves a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment,Recognition of the inflation-unemployment tradeoff in the context of concerns about prolonged low rates suggests caution about overly accommodative policy when employment is already strong,Employment
PC_0024,"Furthermore, if labor markets remain as tight as they are now for any extended period in the future, at some point workers are not going to feel insecure any longer.",Sustained tight labor markets will eventually eliminate worker job insecurity,"This suggests that a key factor restraining wage growth will dissipate if tight conditions persist, creating additional upward pressure on wages and supporting tighter policy",Employment
PC_0025,"However, as of yet, slackening labor markets have not resulted in lower wage inflation in the District.",Labor market slackening has not yet resulted in lower wage inflation despite weakening conditions,"While wage inflation persists, the acknowledgment of slackening labor markets suggests underlying weakness that supports accommodative policy, with wage pressures likely to ease with time",Employment
PC_0026,"Overall, the situation is fairly steady according to my FedEx contact. International business continues to be very robust, growing by 15 to 20 percent year over year.",Business contacts report strong overall demand with steady conditions and robust international growth,Strong and steady domestic conditions combined with robust international growth (15-20% year over year) indicate strong economic momentum that supports restrictive monetary policy.,Growth
PC_0027,"The ECI appears well behaved and wage increases are unlikely to swamp productivity gains, so that should assure that unit labor costs [will remain] in line.",Employment costs are well-behaved and unlikely to drive inflation,"Controlled wage growth relative to productivity gains means employment expansion can continue without creating cost-push inflation, supporting accommodative policy to promote further employment gains.",Employment
PC_0028,continuing on our current policy rate path will likely further flatten the Phillips curve and continue to anchor expectations below our 2 percent target.,Current policy path will keep inflation expectations anchored below the 2% target,"If current policy path keeps expectations below target, this argues for less aggressive tightening to allow inflation to reach the 2% target",Inflation
PC_0029,"GDP growth this year looks to be a touch above 3 percent, and the labor market continues to get stronger. Wage growth has increased near levels consistent with productivity trends and 2 percent inflation.",Labor market continues to strengthen with wage growth at appropriate levels,Strong labor market conditions with wage growth consistent with productivity and inflation targets suggests the economy can handle continued policy tightening,Employment
PC_0030,"This is speculating on his part, but he knows the data very well, and he's saying that companies at the lower end may not be filling these openings because they are not trying that hard to fill them. The openings are there, and at the right wage these firms would fill them. But they are not raising wages enough to fill them.",Companies may not be trying hard enough to fill job openings due to insufficient wage offers,"Suggests wage rigidity may be preventing full employment, implying labor market tightness may be less concerning for inflation than it appears",Employment
PC_0031,"One simple one is obviously that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than we anticipated. If that were the case, that would obviously be a very welcome development, because it would indicate that we had a labor market with fewer frictions that could employ a greater proportion of those looking for work without generating inflation.","Natural rate of unemployment may be lower than previously estimated, indicating a labor market with fewer frictions","A lower natural rate of unemployment would mean the current unemployment rate is less tight than previously thought, reducing the urgency for restrictive monetary policy and allowing for more employment without inflationary consequences.",Employment
PC_0032,"Under this scenario, inflation probably would increase modestly above 2 percent in 2021. But given the flat Phillips curve, the amount of resource pressure we envision, by itself, is not going to generate a great deal of inflation overshooting.",Flat Phillips curve limits inflation overshooting concerns,"The flat Phillips curve parameter suggests limited risk of significant inflation overshooting, supporting more accommodative policy without excessive inflation concerns.",Inflation
PC_0033,"the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment, and core inflation is at a fairly low rate by historical standards",Core inflation is currently at fairly low levels by historical standards,Low current inflation suggests less immediate need for restrictive monetary policy,Inflation
PC_0034,"I'm supportive of allowing a modest undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment. With inflation having run below our 2 percent inflation objective every single month since I joined the Board four and a half years ago, I do not expect to feel alarmed if inflation moves modestly above 2 percent, except in what, in my view, is the the highly unlikely case in which longer-run inflation expectations move up excessively. I believe that this approach may help repair some of the residual labor market damage at little risk to price stability.",Support for allowing unemployment to undershoot natural rate to repair labor market damage,Supporting unemployment below the natural rate to repair residual labor market damage suggests maintaining accommodative policy longer to achieve full recovery,Employment
PC_0035,"Assuming that both firms and workers recognize the tradeoff they face between benefits and take-home pay, slower benefits growth should be reflected in faster wage and salary growth. So, on its own, faster wage and salary growth is not cause for alarm.",Wage growth may reflect wage-benefit tradeoffs rather than concerning labor cost increases,Argues that wage growth alone should not trigger policy concerns because it may simply reflect compositional shifts within total compensation rather than inflationary pressure,Employment
PC_0036,"On the other hand, the August employment reports suggest that labor markets have become even tighter, raising the danger of a still faster acceleration of wages and therefore increasing the risk of higher price inflation going forward even if growth has slowed to trend.",Tighter labor markets raise the risk of wage acceleration and higher price inflation going forward,"The speaker identifies increased inflation risk from tight labor markets, which would support tightening monetary policy to prevent wage-price acceleration",Inflation
PC_0037,I think we need confirmation that our above-trend outlook for economic growth is still on track to drive continued labor market improvement. That is an important channel for many of our inflation projections to rise to trend.,Need for continued labor market improvement as crucial channel for inflation to reach target,"Emphasizes that continued labor market improvement is essential for achieving inflation targets, suggesting policy should remain accommodative until there's confirmation this improvement will continue",Employment
PC_0038,"To be sure, higher dollar exchange rates and softer economies among our major trading partners don't indicate a major boom for the export sector.",Higher dollar and softer foreign economies constrain export sector growth,"Export sector headwinds constrain overall economic growth, supporting the case for accommodative monetary policy",Growth
PC_0039,"As the unemployment rate gradually falls, we need to see inflation increase to the target. We need for it to be more than just a forecast. We need to actually see it begin to increase, and, frankly, I think we probably would benefit from slightly overshooting that inflation objective.","As unemployment falls, inflation needs to increase toward target",Need for inflation to actually rise as unemployment falls supports maintaining accommodation until inflation targets are achieved,Employment
PC_0040,"Initially, an acceleration in productivity yields a powerful disinflationary impetus. It may allow a decline in both unemployment and inflation.",Productivity acceleration initially causes powerful disinflationary effects,The disinflationary effects of productivity acceleration provide room for more accommodative monetary policy during the initial phase,Inflation
PC_0041,"I am concerned that, with two or three more rate increases, it is possible that we could invert the yield curve and increase the risk of recession.",Aggressive monetary tightening path could cause recession and yield curve inversion,Warning that aggressive rate increases could cause recession through yield curve inversion argues against restrictive monetary policy,Growth
PC_0042,"But, given the tight labor market and my expectation that real GDP growth will be at or above its long-run trend rate this year, I remain hopeful that the recent softness in prices will prove to be transitory, and that we will see inflation move back up close to its target before year-end.","Tight labor market and strong GDP growth should lead inflation to return to target, making current softness transitory",The causal relationship between tight labor markets/strong growth and inflation supports maintaining current policy stance as inflation should naturally return to target,Inflation
PC_0043,"Presumably, the failure of the economy to slow enough to keep resource utilization rates from continuously rising further would signal an unsustainable situation that would prompt action, whatever the news on costs and prices. This circumstance would be similar to the one the Committee faced in March--but now at a lower unemployment rate.",Continued decline in unemployment would signal unsustainable situation requiring policy action,"Further declines in unemployment would indicate an unsustainable economic situation that would necessitate monetary policy tightening, regardless of inflation data, to prevent overheating.",Employment
PC_0044,"As has been the case for the last several years, the forces of inflation in the economy seem stronger than the forces of expansion. Unless something different is done, we will continue to be compelled to trade off employment and production as we attempt to restrain inflation.","Current monetary policy approach compels trading off employment to restrain inflation, and this pattern will continue","The speaker acknowledges that anti-inflation policy requires sacrificing employment, implying support for restrictive monetary policy despite its negative employment effects. The argument suggests this tradeoff is necessary given the strength of inflationary forces.",Employment
PC_0045,"First, the upside risk to growth that seemed somewhat possible a month or two ago seemed to have diminished. Much faster growth would presumably have involved more rapid employment growth that would then boost incomes, leading to ever stronger consumption growth, which in turn would sustain greater payroll employment gains. However, the soft employment and consumption figures indicate that this positive multiplier story hasn't taken hold with any vigor.",Upside growth risks have diminished due to lack of employment-consumption multiplier effects,"Absence of positive employment-consumption feedback loop reduces growth prospects, supporting accommodative policy",Growth
PC_0046,"One is the pent-up demand that Mr. Kichline referred to before, combined with the tendencies toward creative financing. At any level of interest rates I think we're liable to see more activity than we might otherwise assume simply because of the way things are being financed these days.",Pent-up demand and creative financing will generate more economic activity at any interest rate level,"The argument that creative financing will generate more economic activity at any interest rate level suggests that monetary policy transmission may be weakened, requiring more restrictive policy to achieve the same restraining effect on growth.",Growth
PC_0047,"What stands out to me is that we haven't any room to grow here, given the declines in productivity and other pressures on the economy. And if we tried to stimulate growth very much, we really would have no chance of dealing with the inflationary psychology; we'd in fact face a blow-off on the inflation side if we don't already have a blow-off.",Economy at capacity with risk of inflation blow-off if growth is stimulated,"The speaker argues that stimulating economic growth would lead to an inflation ""blow-off"" and undermine efforts to combat inflationary psychology, supporting restrictive monetary policy to prevent overheating.",Inflation
PC_0048,But our view that the Phillips curve is no longer accelerationist limits the upside risk to inflation even with an unemployment rate a little below 3½ percent.,"Phillips curve is no longer accelerationist, limiting upside inflation risk","Belief in non-accelerationist Phillips curve reduces concerns about inflation spiraling upward, supporting more accommodative policy",Inflation
PC_0049,"And as many of us have noted over time, if aggregate demand does weaken, output gaps will fail to close and overall price pressures should wane.",Weak aggregate demand will reduce price pressures through output gaps,The expectation that weak demand will naturally reduce inflationary pressures through the output gap mechanism supports less restrictive monetary policy,Inflation
PC_0050,"In tandem with this outlook, I expect unemployment to continue to decline, averaging 5.8 percent by the fourth quarter of this year. I tried to get to the lowest number on the Committee, but I see that Charlie Plosser tied me on this dimension. I interpret the continuing declines in unemployment as indicative of a clearly improving labor market.","Forecast of unemployment declining to 5.8% by year-end, indicating clearly improving labor market",Forecasting continued rapid unemployment decline to 5.8% suggests strong labor market momentum that supports tighter monetary policy,Employment
PC_0051,We still expect the economy to bottom in the first half of 1980 and quite possibly in the first quarter.,Forecast that the economy will bottom in first half of 1980,Expecting economic weakness suggests potential need for accommodative monetary policy to support recovery,Growth
PC_0052,"Incentive programs continued to boost light vehicle sales more than expected last month, and October and November are now in the record books as the highest back-to-back months for such sales ever. But dealers are being cautious about restocking, and automakers have not boosted production significantly because they know that the recent sales pace cannot be sustained.",Vehicle sales reached record levels but pace is unsustainable,"While sales were strong, the unsustainable nature and subsequent weakening suggest underlying economic fragility requiring policy support",Growth
PC_0053,"Of course, from the U.S. standpoint the corresponding rise in the dollar would be one channel through which your tightening would damp demand on U.S. productive capacity.",Policy transmission mechanism through exchange rate would dampen demand on productive capacity,Describes how restrictive policy would work to reduce demand pressures on productive capacity through exchange rate appreciation.,Growth
PC_0054,"However, the continuing announcement of shrinkage by major employers, the difficulties on Wall Street, and certain base closings would lead one to believe that for the rest of the year the economy in the District is likely to be flat.",District economy likely to remain flat for rest of year due to structural headwinds,Forecast of continued weak growth due to employment cuts and financial sector difficulties suggests need for supportive monetary policy,Growth
PC_0055,"For the period from 1960 to the present, I find that a very simple Phillips curve specification does not out-predict the random walk out of sample except at times when unemployment is at least 1 percentage point above its average for the previous six years.",Phillips curve forecasting is most reliable when unemployment is significantly elevated,"This research finding suggests that traditional employment-inflation relationships are less reliable near full employment, implying that policymakers have more flexibility to maintain accommodative policies without clear inflationary signals from employment conditions.",Employment
PC_0056,"This alternative might also be interpreted as allowing for more rapid expansion of nominal income than the other alternatives, on the thought that the structure of labor markets would permit the accommodation of one-time increases in some prices--for example, for imports--without entrenching them in wages and in a more general inflation process.",Labor market structure can accommodate one-time price increases without triggering wage-price spirals,"This structural view of labor markets suggests that employment can remain stable even with some price increases, reducing the need for restrictive monetary policy to prevent wage-price spirals",Employment
PC_0057,"We continue to hear anecdotal reports of hard-to-fill jobs. There are few reports of significant compensation pressures, but some are now increasing benefits to retain and attract some types of workers and others are planning to increase wages.",Labor markets showing signs of tightness with hard-to-fill jobs and emerging compensation pressures,"Signs of labor market tightness and emerging wage pressures indicate reduced slack, supporting less accommodative monetary policy",Employment
PC_0058,Payroll employment in the region grew a little more slowly at the end of 1994 than it had earlier in the year and then dropped in January.,Regional employment growth is slowing and payroll employment dropped in January,Weakening employment growth suggests economic softening that would support more accommodative monetary policy to support labor market recovery,Employment
PC_0059,"Taken together, all this information may indicate that labor and product market constraints are not quite as tight as historical precedents would suggest.",Labor and product market constraints may not be as tight as historical precedents suggest,"Less tight constraints suggest the economy has more room to grow without generating inflationary pressures, allowing for more accommodative policy",Growth
PC_0060,"I'm certainly not attempting to say that we ought to crush the economy but we just can't lose sight of the basic fact that what we're trying to do is to keep that steady pressure on--we have some luck here in food and fuel prices--and if we keep the pressure on, we can get some movement in the wage-price structure and begin to get this spiral going in the other direction.",The Fed must maintain steady pressure to reverse the inflation spiral while avoiding excessive economic damage,"This supports maintaining restrictive monetary policy with steady pressure rather than easing, arguing that sustained pressure can reverse the wage-price spiral and that current favorable food/fuel price developments provide an opportunity.",Inflation
PC_0061,"But as more workers are drawn into or remain in the labor force, I'd expect the tax cuts to have only a small effect on the unemployment rate and, with the expected increase in the productive capacity of the economy, only a muted effect on inflation.",Tax cuts will have muted effect on inflation due to increased productive capacity,Limited inflationary impact from fiscal stimulus suggests no need for more aggressive monetary tightening in response,Inflation
PC_0062,"To be sure, slack should be diminishing, businesses will try to resist any squeeze on markups, and the economy may be closer to potential than it appears right now.",Labor market slack should be diminishing going forward,Expected diminishing slack and possibility that the economy is closer to potential than apparent suggests future need for less accommodative monetary policy to prevent overheating,Employment
PC_0063,"One clear message was that it is difficult to generate undesirably high inflation with our currently preferred specification for the Phillips curve, which is non-accelerationist and has a very flat slope.",Flat Phillips curve makes high inflation difficult to generate,"Structural relationship suggests low risk of excessive inflation, supporting gradual policy normalization",Inflation
PC_0064,"On inflation, I tend to take the conventional view that the extent of slack and declining commodity prices, because of both domestic and foreign slow growth, will lead to declining inflation.",Economic slack and declining commodity prices will lead to declining inflation,The causal forecast that economic slack and falling commodity prices will reduce inflation supports accommodative policy to counteract these disinflationary pressures.,Inflation
PC_0065,"We've also seen a slight uptick in the region's labor force participation rate, and we continue to hear of reduced resistance to raising wages.",Rising labor force participation and increasing wage pressures indicate tight labor market,"Rising participation and wage pressures signal a tight labor market that could generate inflationary pressures, supporting restrictive policy",Employment
PC_0066,"Conditions did not push core inflation up to 2 percent on a consistent basis last year even with growth well above trend, unemployment well below estimates of the natural rate, and our policy rate still below most estimates of neutral.",Inflation failed to reach 2% consistently despite strong economic conditions in the previous year,The failure of strong economic conditions to generate target-consistent inflation suggests the need for continued accommodative policy to achieve the inflation mandate.,Inflation
PC_0067,"In any case, I'm open to the idea that there may be remaining margins of slack. Inflation is below target and real long-term interest rates are low, and this combination indicates either that there is remaining slack or that the economy is still experiencing significant headwinds and requires accommodative policy",Remaining employment slack and below-target inflation indicate need for continued accommodative policy,Speaker directly argues that potential remaining employment slack combined with below-target inflation justifies maintaining accommodative monetary policy,Employment
PC_0068,"With a sizable output gap and low inflation and inflation expectations, the odds on easing so much now that we produce inflation down the road seem very, very small.",Sizable output gap and low inflation make aggressive easing low-risk,"Large output gap provides substantial room for monetary stimulus without inflation risk, supporting aggressive easing.",Growth

PC_0070,"We now have had about six quarters in which the rate of growth in nonfarm compensation, as measured by the ECI, has been falling in spite of continued low measured levels of labor market slack.","Observation that compensation growth has been falling for six quarters despite continued low unemployment, surprising economic models","Unexpectedly restrained wage growth despite low unemployment suggests less inflationary pressure from labor markets than traditional models would predict, supporting accommodative policy",Employment
PC_0071,"As I've emphasized in the past, even if all you want to do is forecast, and you don't care about all of the theoretical issues, the relationships between the slack measures and the actual inflation outcomes are questionable themselves and are weak and, I think, have gotten weaker over time.","The relationship between slack measures and inflation outcomes has weakened over time, making slack-based monetary policy less reliable","The speaker's skepticism about the Phillips curve relationship suggests less confidence in using accommodative monetary policy to influence inflation through labor market slack, arguing against aggressive easing",Inflation
PC_0072,"At the national level, we see an economy that continues to ""hum along"" with few, if any, of the signs of slowing that many of us have been forecasting for several meetings now.",Current national economy continues strong performance despite earlier forecasts of slowing,"Continued strong economic performance suggests the economy may be running above sustainable levels, potentially warranting tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating",Growth
PC_0073,We think resource utilization likely will be about neutral for inflation over this forecast period. Our GDP projection does not result in appreciable resource slack over the forecast period.,Resource utilization will be neutral for inflation with no appreciable resource slack,"Neutral resource utilization suggests no inflationary pressures from economic slack, supporting the case for accommodative policy",Inflation
PC_0074,"Another, I think, sort of depressing factor in our area is the drought condition, and immediately that is the lack of snow. The ski industry in the Rocky Mountain areas through our District--principally Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico--equals the summer tourist rate in that area. Unless snow comes on rather quickly, the spending that normally takes place starting in the Thanksgiving weekend is not going to take place.","Drought and lack of snow will reduce ski industry tourism spending, eliminating a major source of regional economic activity","The forecast of reduced tourism spending represents a significant negative shock to regional economic growth, supporting the case for accommodative monetary policy to offset this weakness.",Growth

PC_0076,"Well, in the staff's estimation, in order to hold down money growth and nominal GNP, you have to have higher real interest rates. And in order to get this kind of price performance by '95 you have to hold [real rates] up there and the unemployment rate has to be high.",Higher real interest rates are necessary to achieve desired price performance by 1995,"Argues that achieving price stability requires maintaining higher real interest rates and accepting higher unemployment, supporting a restrictive monetary policy stance.",Inflation
PC_0077,Wage pressures are reported to be significant only for health-care workers.,Wage pressures are limited to only the healthcare sector,"The absence of broad wage pressures indicates slack in the labor market, which supports accommodative monetary policy as there is little risk of wage-driven inflation from employment conditions",Employment
PC_0078,One explanation is that it's the intercept of the Phillips curve that may be significantly lower than in the past.,The Phillips curve intercept may be significantly lower than in the past,Lower Phillips curve intercept means more economic stimulus is needed to generate the same level of inflation,Inflation
PC_0079,I would say that based upon [the Board staff's] forecast and ours it wouldn't be surprising to see labor market slack and a reduced core rate of inflation below that incorporated in the Greenbook.,Expected labor market slack to persist,"Forecasted persistence of labor market slack suggests unemployment will remain elevated, supporting accommodative monetary policy to stimulate job creation and reduce unemployment.",Employment
PC_0080,"Based on our August survey, which will be released this Thursday, that trend continued in August. The new data suggested some contraction in regional manufacturing this month; the August number is minus 3.1.

PC_0081,I must admit I've been struck by what I've been hearing about the continued lack of build-up in wage and compensation pressures,Continued absence of wage and compensation pressure buildup in current employment conditions,"The persistent lack of wage and compensation pressure buildup indicates employment conditions are not contributing to inflationary pressures, supporting accommodative monetary policy",Employment
PC_0082,"Economic indicators since our last meeting were somewhat mixed. An earlier-than-expected stabilization of inventories raised fourth-quarter GDP. Overall, though, the outlook does not appear much changed from previous meetings. Participants continue to project a moderate recovery, picking up in 2011, but with high and only slowly improving unemployment rates.","Economic indicators are mixed with moderate recovery projected, but outlook unchanged from previous meetings with high unemployment persisting",Mixed indicators and persistent high unemployment despite moderate recovery projections suggest continued need for monetary policy support,Growth

But that work also confirms that the slope of the curve has been flat for a couple of decades.","The Phillips curve maintains an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment but with a very flat slope, providing limited guidance for monetary policy","The flat Phillips curve suggests that labor market tightening is less likely to generate significant inflation pressures, reducing the urgency for restrictive monetary policy",Inflation
PC_0165,"I think the bottom line here is that we should be quite skeptical about jumping to the conclusion that it's only short-term unemployment, which is now down to normal levels, that drives inflation.","Skepticism that only short-term unemployment drives inflation, suggesting broader labor market slack matters","If both short-term and long-term unemployment affect inflation, then continued high long-term unemployment justifies maintaining accommodative policy to address this broader source of disinflationary pressure.",Inflation
PC_0166,"We're in an environment in which the natural rate of interest is very low and in which inflation is not responding as we expect when we run a ""hot"" economy.",Structural changes in how tight labor markets affect inflation,"If tight labor markets no longer generate expected inflation, this suggests structural changes that may require more accommodative policy to achieve inflation targets",Employment
PC_0167,"Progress in the labor market has continued. Interestingly, the composition of that progress has changed with a shift toward the participation margin, suggesting a greater elasticity of labor supply than previously thought.",Labor supply appears more elastic than previously thought,"Greater labor supply elasticity suggests employment can expand further without generating significant wage or price pressures, supporting accommodative policy",Employment
PC_0168,"But I wouldn't expect to see a strong acceleration in wages unless we see a stronger pickup in productivity growth. But then again, this would be welcome, as wage growth reflecting higher productivity growth has not contributed to inflationary pressures in the competitive economy.",Productivity-driven wage growth does not contribute to inflationary pressures,"This view suggests that wage growth backed by productivity gains is not inflationary, potentially reducing the need for restrictive policy in response to wage increases",Inflation
PC_0169,"I think we should emphasize what you said, Mike, only if the relationship between the unemployment rate and the potential rate of operations of the economy as a whole were very tight. The data show that that is not the case. That's because the measurement problems that we have in all these statistics are fairly large and even if we had an exact or very tight relationship the data are going to be wrong.",The relationship between unemployment rate and economic capacity is not tight enough to rely on for policy decisions due to measurement problems and data uncertainty,"This argument suggests caution about using unemployment as a guide for policy tightening, supporting a more accommodative stance by questioning the reliability of traditional unemployment-based policy signals",Employment
PC_0170,The elevated rate of growth in compensation per hour from the productivity and cost report over the past year far exceeds the readings provided by these other series and may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight labor markets and wage pressures.,Compensation per hour growth may be misleading about wage pressures,"Suggests wage pressures may not be as strong as some indicators suggest, reducing inflationary concerns and need for restrictive policy",Inflation
PC_0171,"In light of the lack of wage pressure to date, I could easily believe that the natural rate of unemployment is below 5 percent, and I will revisit this estimate if we continue to see very modest wage and salary increases as labor markets, I hope, continue to improve.",Natural unemployment rate may be below 5% based on lack of wage pressure,"Lower natural rate implies more room for employment gains before reaching full employment, supporting continued accommodative policy",Employment
PC_0172,"On the wage front also there is no change. The settlements, in my view at least, continue to be quite constructive and not indicative of the wage pressures that you might expect.",Wage settlements remain constructive without expected wage pressures,"The lack of wage pressures suggests that a key driver of inflation remains subdued, indicating that monetary policy need not be restrictive to contain wage-driven inflation, supporting a more accommodative stance.",Inflation
PC_0173,"Finally, it is worth repeating that if and as accelerating wage increases do diffuse more broadly through the economy, the size and timing of their effect on price inflation of tightening labor markets remain unclear.",The causal link from tighter employment to inflation is uncertain and likely to be attenuated,Uncertainty about employment-inflation linkages suggests less urgency for preemptive tightening,Employment
PC_0174,This adds to my skepticism about arguments that link inflation too closely with resource utilization.,Skepticism about the relationship between resource utilization and inflation,"Questioning the Phillips curve relationship suggests that economic slack may not reliably reduce inflation, supporting more restrictive policy to directly address inflation pressures",Inflation
PC_0175,"I expect that, as this new phase takes hold, we will see many more markets, including labor markets, firm up because of the increases in demand. A natural element of this business-cycle process should also include, in due course, a rise in the equilibrium real rate of interest.",Increased demand will cause markets to firm up and naturally lead to higher equilibrium real interest rates,Expectation that demand increases will firm up markets and naturally raise equilibrium real rates supports moving toward less accommodative policy,Growth
PC_0176,"Wage growth continues to rise slowly with average hourly earnings running above 3 percent for the past two months, which, as others have noted, considering productivity, is consistent with our 2 percent inflation target.",Current wage growth is consistent with the 2% inflation target,The assessment that current wage growth is consistent with the inflation target suggests no need for tighter monetary policy to control inflation pressures.,Inflation
PC_0177,"Even though many of our forecasts have the unemployment rate running 1 full percentage point or more below its natural rate, the flat Phillips curve means that this boosts inflation two- or three-tenths at most.","Unemployment is forecasted to run significantly below its natural rate, but the flat Phillips curve limits inflationary impact","Unemployment running well below its natural rate indicates an overheated labor market that would typically call for restrictive monetary policy, though the flat Phillips curve relationship suggests limited inflationary pressure from this labor market tightness.",Employment
PC_0178,"Third, while it's clear that temporary factors were a contributing factor in holding down inflation last year, because I view the underlying trend to be low and the Phillips curve to be very flat, I'm not confident that inflation will be as close to our objective by the end of the year as it is in the Tealbook baseline.",Inflation is unlikely to reach target by end of year due to low underlying trend and flat Phillips curve,Skepticism about reaching inflation target suggests need for more accommodative policy than baseline projections assume,Inflation
PC_0179,"Second, it may be unwise to cite low unemployment or faster growth alone as factors suggesting higher inflation in the future.",Faster growth alone should not be cited as justification for expecting higher inflation,Argues against using faster growth as justification for policy tightening based on inflation concerns,Growth
PC_0180,"The final factor that might be relevant is the fact that labor compensation and inflation trends are unusually low at the current unemployment rate. Now, I'm not sure what this precisely means in terms of how much slack we have and what that means for the full-employment unemployment rate, but when the labor compensation trends are this low, it would seem to allow us the ability to be somewhat more patient.",Unusually low labor compensation at current unemployment levels allows for more patient monetary policy,Low wage growth at current employment levels suggests remaining slack and directly supports the preference for more patient (accommodative) monetary policy,Employment
PC_0181,The damped growth of compensation even in the face of higher headline inflation indicates to me that appreciable slack remains in labor markets.,Significant slack remains in labor markets as evidenced by weak compensation growth despite higher inflation,"Labor market slack suggests room for employment growth without generating wage-driven inflation pressures, supporting accommodative policy",Employment
PC_0182,High capacity utilization creates conditions that I think are even more favorable for making price increases stick.,High capacity utilization creates favorable conditions for price increases to stick,Identifying current high capacity utilization as creating conditions favorable for price increases suggests inflationary pressures that would warrant restrictive monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising,Inflation
PC_0183,"we do continue to expect this growth to moderate in 2019 and move toward potential in 2020, mainly because of aging workforce demographics, continued sluggish productivity due to lagging education and skill levels, and other structural challenges that are likely to create headwinds for economic growth in the medium term.",Medium-term structural challenges including aging demographics and sluggish productivity will create growth headwinds,"Structural headwinds to growth suggest lower potential growth and employment, which could warrant more accommodative policy to support economic activity",Employment
PC_0184,"It is an important issue because to the extent that we have big wage increases as a consequence of, or tied to, profitability, such increases are not necessarily inflationary. That is true because as costs go up in relation to prices, profit margins are squeezed and those wages automatically start to adjust down.",Profit-linked wages create less inflationary pressure than traditional wage increases,"This mechanism suggests that wage increases tied to profitability are self-limiting and less inflationary, reducing the need for restrictive monetary policy to combat wage-driven inflation.",Growth
PC_0185,"The significant slack in the labor markets will continue to place a lot of downward pressure on inflation, and there remains a significant risk that deflation will not be avoided.",Labor market slack will create sustained downward pressure on inflation with significant deflation risk,"The speaker forecasts continued disinflationary pressure from labor market slack and warns of deflation risk, both of which would justify more accommodative monetary policy to prevent deflation and support inflation toward target levels.",Inflation
PC_0186,"At the same time, upward wage pressures will not likely bubble up into upward price pressures as much as one might think because of continuing offsetting smaller benefit costs and strong competition for products and services.",Wage pressures are unlikely to translate into broader price pressures due to benefit cost offsets and competitive forces,The forecast that wage pressures won't translate to broader inflation due to structural mitigating factors suggests less need for preemptive monetary tightening to address employment-driven inflationary concerns,Employment
PC_0187,"I haven't seen the evidence of that yet. I know that in recent months, there's been a little bit of an uptick, but on a year-over-year basis, there's not any real evidence of it. So, for me, I need to see real evidence that we're moving toward 2 percent before I can support a rate increase.",Clear evidence of inflation moving toward 2% is required before supporting interest rate increases,Setting a high evidentiary bar for inflation progress before supporting rate increases implies maintaining accommodative policy until clear inflation gains are observed,Inflation
PC_0188,"So we may have the worst of both worlds in 1979, in that inflation will not have cooled down under the impact of greater unemployment by year-end and some mild recession by year-end. But we'll have both the inflation and the soft economy looking ahead to twelve months from today.","Inflation may persist despite recession, creating a stagflation scenario where traditional Phillips curve relationships break down","If inflation persists despite recession, it suggests entrenched expectations requiring more aggressive policy action rather than relying on unemployment to reduce inflation",Inflation
PC_0189,"One of the things we may be seeing with regard to the story on structural productivity is that it's a little stronger than we had originally thought. That said, obviously it will have to come off a bit for cyclical reasons in order for job creation to pick up.",Productivity must decline cyclically for job creation to pick up,The need for cyclical productivity moderation to support employment suggests accommodative policy may be needed to facilitate this transition,Growth
PC_0190,These are the tug of war between the momentum in domestic demand and the expected external drag from Asia and the tug of war between very tight labor markets and the forces that have restrained and appear likely to continue to restrain inflation.,Current labor markets are very tight and represent a key economic force in the current environment,Very tight labor markets create upward pressure that may require restrictive monetary policy to counteract potential inflationary effects,Employment
PC_0191,"I think a democratic society is not stable by its very nature, but rather that it can be made stable if the people in the country feel that they really have a reasonable opportunity for a better life ahead. We need sustained economic growth to do that.",Sustained economic growth and employment opportunities are necessary for democratic stability,"This view that employment opportunities are crucial for social stability suggests a preference for policies that support sustained growth and job creation, favoring accommodative monetary policy",Employment
PC_0192,"However, the evidence suggests that prices and wages react with a considerable lag to shifts in output and employment, and Japan provides a useful cautionary example.",Prices and wages react with considerable lags to changes in output and employment,"The lagged response of prices and wages to economic conditions suggests that disinflationary pressures may persist even as the economy recovers, supporting continued accommodative policy.",Inflation
PC_0193,"I continue to expect GDP growth to pick up over time, which will bring the unemployment rate down toward its natural rate and pull inflation up toward our 2 percent objective, broadly similar to the Tealbook outlook.",Forecast of unemployment declining toward natural rate as GDP growth picks up,Forecasting improving employment conditions suggests less need for continued monetary stimulus,Employment
PC_0194,"These tighter conditions seem to be leading to some increases in the growth of base pay. But with a few exceptions, the increases are quite modest and on the order of .2 to .3 percent higher than a year ago.",Tight labor conditions are leading to modest increases in wage growth,"Even modest wage increases driven by tight labor conditions suggest emerging inflationary pressures that could accelerate, warranting preemptive restrictive policy action.",Employment
PC_0195,"There is nothing whatever wrong about the phrase that says the ""primary long-term goal"" is price stability. In fact, it is one hundred percent right. That is what we do now. It's exactly correct, and I am perfectly happy with that in the law. You might even argue that it is the only long-term goal; I am not sure what else we can do in the long term. But, in the short term, there are other goals.",Employment should be considered a legitimate short-term goal of monetary policy alongside long-term price stability,"Acknowledging employment as a legitimate short-term monetary policy goal provides justification for accommodative policy when unemployment is elevated, even if long-term focus remains on price stability.",Employment
PC_0196,"I remember the summer of 1984, sitting around this table with many of the people who are here today, and it was very easy then to simply project the trends of early 1984, which looked tremendously strong. And, frankly, we missed the fact that business was going to slow down; just about the time we thought it was looking most terrific was when we got the 90-degree turn. I hope we are not doing that today.","Warning that current strong economic trends could reverse quickly, based on 1984 experience when growth slowed despite appearing strong",The warning about potential for sudden growth slowdowns despite current strength suggests caution in tightening policy and supports maintaining accommodative stance to avoid contributing to a downturn,Growth
PC_0197,"In order to achieve these projected growth rates, I assume that we provide further policy accommodation by extending the period of very low rates into 2015.",Achieving projected growth rates requires extended policy accommodation through 2015,Explicitly states that achieving growth targets causally depends on extended monetary accommodation,Growth
PC_0198,"I hope that productivity improvements will contain labor cost pressures, but it seems to me that there are some limits to this process.",Productivity improvements have limits in their ability to contain labor cost pressures,"The belief that productivity gains have structural limits in offsetting wage pressures suggests that relying on productivity alone to contain inflation is insufficient, implying need for restrictive monetary policy to address wage-driven inflation risks.",Inflation
PC_0199,"We would see that, however, being accompanied by some pretty strong wage and price pressures.",Forecast of strong wage and price pressures accompanying economic growth,"The speaker forecasts strong price pressures accompanying economic growth, which suggests the need for restrictive monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures.",Inflation
